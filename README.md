# Inconsistent Date Comparisons in PHP Due to Time Zone Issues
This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP date and time handling that can lead to inconsistencies in date comparisons, particularly across daylight saving time transitions. The issue stems from PHP's implicit reliance on the server's time zone setting and the potential for `strtotime` to produce unexpected results under certain circumstances.

## Problem
The provided PHP code attempts to compare a current date with a future date one month ahead.  However, due to inconsistencies in how PHP handles time zones and daylight saving time, the comparison may yield incorrect results depending on the server's configuration and the specific date range.
